# Projects
A catalog of the various projects I have undertaken throughout my time with computer science, made in coordination with my UC Berkely computer science courses.

What I have uploaded so far:

  A game of checkers with the special functionality that some pieces explode upon capturing (bombs) and others are immune to         bomb blasts
  
  A visual simulation of the solar system (or any other planetary arrangement) that is mathematically correct given any input        masses and positions of the desired celestial bodies. Also includes various staring scenarios, which i did not write.
  
  
Projects I still need to upload:

  A Plants vs. Zombies spinoff
  
  A Dice Game of Hog
  
  An algorithm that calculates the sentiments associated with a database of tweets on a given subject and maps them visually by      color
  
  A keyboard-based guitar synthesizer
